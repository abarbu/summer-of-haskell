title: Godot Haskell games!
---

Games have traditionally not been Haskell's strong suit. With the advent of
Godot and he new low-latency GC this can finally change. We've built friendly
bindings to Godot and have already constructed several 2D games.

[Try out the bindings and example games yourself!](https://github.com/simulaVR/godot-haskell/)

It's time to move into the 3rd dimension! We want someone to build 3D games,
starting with the example from the Godot documentation. Early-intermediate
Haskell experience required, no Godot experience necessary but it would be a
bonus. Along the way, we would like you to document the process and help build
up a community around Godot-Haskell. After the initial 3D game from the Godot
docs, this project is wide open, you can build more example games, help improve
the API, or try out something completely new!

**Mentors**: Andrei Barbu @abarbu and David Kraeutmann @KaneTW

**Difficulty**: Beginner - Intermediate
